# Pou paoun ta leuta mou

This project aims to build a system that would allow for exploring the budget of the Republic of Cyprus. The data is available in a pdf form from here : http://bit.ly/2biYQ0y 

Because the data is not available in any other form the pdf file was parsed and cleaned using Tabula and Google Refine. The extracted data is available in a clean format in "proupologismos-revised-csv.csv".

#State of the project

As of writing this document the project allows the exploration of the money allocated to each Ministry and how this sum was distributed among the offices belonging to each Ministry. The years available are 2014,2015,2016,2017,2018. There are cases where the sum allocated was revised and this is inidcated in the table. For each office the sum allocated is further distributed for current expendinture, development expenditure and the consolidated fund available to that office.

#Future

Would like to add the functionality stated in Issues.
